# cruise_catch
Using data collected as part of the Juvenile Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment Survey, this project was created to make a Shiny App and produce underlying R code to produce maps of the distribution and abundance of catch. The URL created from this project is available to examine spatial distribution patterns between years for a given species, and will hopefully serve as a resource for future researchers interested in catch data from the last 30+ years. The final_forloop script produces pdf files of the desired species, year combination. This project is currently finished as of 09/04/18 and the shiny app is live. In the future, I may re-visit this site to generate maps of specific spp.
